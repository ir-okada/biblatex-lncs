# biblatex-lncs

BibLaTeX style for Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science

## Introduction

The code works with `biblatex 2.2` and it requires `biber 1.2` as backend. It
extends the standard `BiBTeX` model by an `acronym` entry.

## Usage

```latex
\usepackage[backend=biber,
  style=lncs
]{biblatex}
```

## Status

I intend to maintain this fork and gladly accept pull requests and issues.

## Testing

For building the included `test.tex` the `llncs` class from the Springer author guidelines needs to be in scope. The CI can get it via the ENV variable `LLNCS_CLS`.
